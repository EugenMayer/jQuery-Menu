A fork of the fg-menu to
 - move css into scss
 - provide a bootstrap theme (compatibiliy to bootstrap)
 - cleanup libs and folders


Sass
You basicaly want to use

 @import "fg.basics";
 @import "fg.bootstrap";

in a project were you have the bootstrap scss files inlcluded, see fg.boostrap.scss as an example (which already includes the bootstrap.scss libs)
